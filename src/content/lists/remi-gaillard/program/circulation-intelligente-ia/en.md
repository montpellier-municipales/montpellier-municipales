Rémi Gaillard proposes using artificial intelligence to fluidify traffic in Montpellier by making traffic lights intelligent.

- **Real-time adaptation**: Adjusting traffic light cycles based on actual vehicle flow.
- **Priority for public transport**: Specific optimization for buses and trams.
- **Pollution reduction**: Fewer stops and starts lead to lower emissions.
- **Transparency**: A real-time public map of traffic status.
