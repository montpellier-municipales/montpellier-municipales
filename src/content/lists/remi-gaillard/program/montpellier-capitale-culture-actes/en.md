Rémi Gaillard proposes making Montpellier a "Capital of Culture through Actions," focusing on free artistic expression, child involvement, and heritage promotion.

- **Memo-lograms**: Immersive urban paths with historical figures telling the city's story.
- **Rooftop Corum**: Transforming the Corum's roof into an open-air cinema or stage.
- **Verdanson Street-art**: Official open-air graffiti gallery with rotating artists.
- **Municipal Orchestra**: Free instruments and music lessons for all children.
- **LEGO Montpellier**: Schools rebuilding neighborhoods in LEGO for public display.
- **100% Culture LED Boards**: Using municipal screens solely for local event promotion.
