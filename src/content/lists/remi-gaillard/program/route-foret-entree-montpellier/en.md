Rémi Gaillard proposes to transform the avenue de Toulouse into a "Forest Road" by removing one traffic lane to create a continuous plant canopy.

- **Unpaving**: Replacing unnecessary asphalt with soil.
- **Continuous Canopy**: Massive tree planting for natural shade and lower temperatures.
- **Green Corridor**: Connecting Parc Montcalm to the city through nature.
- **Urban Aesthetics**: Radically changing the city entrance from "all-car" to "all-green."
