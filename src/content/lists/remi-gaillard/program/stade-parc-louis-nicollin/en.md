Rémi Gaillard proposes the creation of the **Louis Nicollin Stade-Parc**, a unique multi-functional facility in France, designed to be a true daily living space integrating sports, culture, and nature.

### An Innovative and Ecological Concept

1.  **Public Rooftop Park**: A landscaped panoramic promenade accessible to all, offering viewpoints over the city and the sea.
2.  **Bioclimatic Design**: A semi-buried stadium for natural protection against wind and heat, featuring a photovoltaic canopy for energy autonomy.
3.  **Retractable Roof**: Allowing year-round use for concerts and major events regardless of the weather.
4.  **Louis Nicollin Museum**: A permanent space dedicated to the unique collection of Louis Nicollin, retracing the history of MHSC.
5.  **House of Sports**: An indoor sports center (table tennis, futsal, 3x3 basketball) open all year round under the stands.
6.  **Controlled Financing**: Construction funded by the club and private investors (naming), without using taxpayer money.

This project aims to provide Montpellier residents with a new "cool island," a strong cultural hub, and a high-level sports infrastructure.
