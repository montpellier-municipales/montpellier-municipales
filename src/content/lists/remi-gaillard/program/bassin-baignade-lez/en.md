Rémi Gaillard proposes installing natural floating swimming pools on the Lez river, accessible to residents in the summer.

- **Natural filtration**: Water filtered by plants and UV systems.
- **Cool island**: A natural breathing space in the heart of the city.
- **Reversible**: Floating wooden structures that respect the river's ecosystem.
- **Transparency**: Real-time water quality monitoring.
