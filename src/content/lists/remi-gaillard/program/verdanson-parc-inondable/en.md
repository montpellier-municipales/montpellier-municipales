Rémi Gaillard proposes to transform the Verdanson canal into a floodable park and an open-air street art museum.

### Key Points:

1.  **Renaturation of the urban corridor**: Replace concrete with natural elements (pebbles, soil, riverside plants) to allow water to penetrate the ground, recreate shade, and bring freshness to the city center.
2.  **Flood-resilient design**: The park will be designed to accommodate the Verdanson's unpredictable floods, with lower sections accepting water while the main pathway remains accessible.
3.  **Enhanced accessibility**: Create gentle access points every 150-250 meters (stairs-seating, ramps) to connect the streets to the canal bed.
4.  **Open-air street art museum**: Officially recognize and foster the existing street art on the Verdanson's walls, with free expression areas, rotating artists, and monumental frescoes with soft lighting.
5.  **Immediate benefits for residents**: Provide a cool oasis in the city center, a free shaded promenade in summer, and a more natural flood management.
6.  **Credible and fundable project**: Avoids expropriation, can be realized in sections, and is eligible for various climate and European funding programs.
