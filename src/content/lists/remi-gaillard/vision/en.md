## An Iconoclastic and Citizen Vision

Rémi Gaillard's political project is articulated around a critique of "professional politicians" and the technocratic management of the city.

### Priority Axes

Although his program for 2026 is still under construction, his historical commitments and first statements outline several priorities:

*   **Animal Cause:** Making Montpellier an exemplary city in terms of animal protection (shelters, ban on circuses with animals, greening).
*   **Solidarity:** Concrete actions for the homeless and the most destitute, often highlighted in his activist actions.
*   **Public Space:** A more playful, freer city, with a critique of excessive concreting.
*   **Direct Democracy:** Giving a voice back to citizens against party logics.

His approach aims to be pragmatic and disruptive, seeking to mobilize the abstentionist electorate and those disappointed by classic politics.
