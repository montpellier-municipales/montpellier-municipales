**Rémi Gaillard** is a comedian, video maker, and activist from Montpellier, world-famous for his pranks and his slogan: *“It's by doing whatever that one becomes whoever”* ("C'est en faisant n'importe quoi qu'on devient n'importe qui").

An atypical and **anti-system** figure, he had already run in the 2020 municipal elections at the head of a citizen and environmentalist list, creating a surprise by garnering nearly **9.6% of the votes** in the first round.

For 2026, he announces his return to the political arena with the desire to offer an **alternative outside traditional parties**, focused on common sense, the protection of living things, and a more direct democracy.
