**Michaël Delafosse**, the outgoing Socialist mayor, is running for re-election in the 2026 municipal elections. He leads a coalition list of the left and "pragmatic" ecologists, supported by the **Socialist Party**, the **Communist Party**, the **Radical Party of the Left**, **Place Publique**, **Génération Écologie**, and the **Animalist Party**.

His project is part of the **continuity** of his first term, claiming a "great transformation" of Montpellier.

His stated priorities:
*   **Mobility:** Perpetuation of free transport and network extension (Line 5).
*   **Urban Planning and Ecology:** Greening of the city, neighborhood renovation (Mosson, Cévennes), and adaptation to climate change.
*   **Security and Public Tranquility:** Reinforcement of the municipal police and a policy of republican firmness.
*   **Public Services:** Defense of a strong and accessible public service (social shield).

Michaël Delafosse wishes to "protect and project" Montpellier into the future, by consolidating the social and ecological achievements of his mandate.
