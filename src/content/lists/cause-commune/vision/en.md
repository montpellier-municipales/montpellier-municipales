## Positioning for the Montpellier Municipal Elections

### A List Under Construction

For the 2026 municipal elections, Cause Commune has officially launched a **call for participation** to form a citizen list. The movement states its intention to take time for collective construction before designating a lead candidate or a finalized program.

This preparatory phase is presented as central to the approach, to avoid excessive personalization of the candidacy and to prioritize the collective project.

### Assumed Political Opposition to the Incumbent Municipality

Beyond strictly municipal issues, Cause Commune has publicly taken a stand on **international political questions with local implications**, thus marking an explicit opposition to the socialist municipal majority currently in power.

The movement has notably launched a **public campaign demanding the end of the twinning between the city of Montpellier and the city of Tiberias (Israel)**. This initiative aims to denounce crimes committed against the Palestinian population in Gaza and to refuse that the city of Montpellier maintains institutional ties with a state engaged in genocidal policies.

In its communications, Cause Commune emphasizes that twinning is a **municipal political choice**, and it is therefore legitimate to debate and challenge it at the local level. This campaign is part of a broader critique of the current municipality's position, accused of silence or inaction on this issue.

### Highlighted Work Axes

At this stage, Cause Commune's public communications highlight several work priorities:

*   **Local Democracy**: strengthening citizen powers, transparency of municipal decisions, participation of residents in structuring choices;
*   **Social Justice**: fight against territorial inequalities, access to public services, particular attention to working-class neighborhoods;
*   **Associative Life and Solidarities**: recognition of the role of local associations, support for citizen initiatives;
*   **Ethical and Political Positioning of the City**: coherence between the values displayed by the municipality and its institutional partnerships, including internationally;
*   **Living Environment**: improvement of daily life, access to public facilities, and consideration of multiple uses of the city.
