**Cause Commune** is a Montpellier-based citizen and political movement. It defines itself as a **collective, locally rooted initiative**, aiming to bring forth a political alternative built from residents, the associative fabric, and working-class neighborhoods of Montpellier.

The movement positions itself outside traditional political parties and emphasizes a desire for **renewal in local political practices**, insisting on citizen participation, local democracy, and consideration of the territory's social realities.

Ahead of the 2026 municipal elections, Cause Commune has announced its intention to **form a list** and has initiated a public process for building its candidacy, without yet designating an official lead candidate.

### A Citizen and Participatory Approach

Cause Commune advocates a method of political construction based on:

* the **direct participation of residents** in the development of the municipal project;
* the organization of **public meetings, workshops, and neighborhood gatherings**;
* opening the movement to individuals not affiliated with political parties;
* a particular focus on **working-class neighborhoods and communities distant from political participation**.

In its public statements, the movement insists on the necessity of moving beyond a strictly representative conception of municipal democracy, favoring more continuous forms of citizen involvement.
