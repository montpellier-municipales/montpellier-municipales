## A Municipal Strategy Assumed by La France Insoumise

For the 2026 municipal elections, La France Insoumise claims an **autonomous presence**, with lists explicitly carrying the Insoumis project, without dilution in management coalitions deemed incompatible with its national orientations.

In Montpellier, this strategy translates into:

* the will to establish a **structured municipal opposition** around the Insoumis program;
* the refusal to limit itself to a supporting role in local majorities led by other political forces;
* the affirmation of a municipal project consistent with LFI's national positions.

### Local Political Positioning

La France Insoumise clearly situates itself in **opposition to the socialist municipality currently in place**. Public statements by LFI elected officials and local leaders regularly question the choices of the municipal majority on several structuring issues.

Among the criticisms formulated are notably:

* municipal and metropolitan governance, deemed insufficiently democratic;
* certain urban planning and development policies;
* the consistency of ecological choices with stated commitments.

LFI thus claims the construction of a **municipal alternative of rupture**, relying on the working classes, working-class neighborhoods, and social mobilizations.

### Programmatic Axes Generally Highlighted

Without a finalized municipal program at this stage, public communications from LFI and Nathalie Oziol nevertheless allow identifying several structuring axes:

* **Social Justice and Public Services**: defense and development of municipal public services, fight against precariousness, effective access to rights;
* **Housing**: criticism of real estate speculation, rent control, development of social housing;
* **Popular Ecology**: ecological transition thought in connection with the living conditions of the working classes, opposition to projects deemed ecologically or socially harmful;
* **Local Democracy**: strengthening citizen participation, transparency of decisions, and control of elected officials;
* **Fight against Discrimination**: anti-racism, gender equality, defense of public freedoms.

These axes are part of the local declension of La France Insoumise's national program.

### An Articulation Between Local and National Issues

La France Insoumise assumes a political reading according to which municipal policies cannot be dissociated from national and international choices. The Montpellier candidacy thus fits into a broader framework, integrating:

* a critique of national policies deemed responsible for worsening inequalities;
* positions on international issues when these have a political or symbolic translation at the local level;
* the will to make the municipality a relay for struggles carried out at other scales.
