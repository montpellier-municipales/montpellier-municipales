## A Gathering Strategy for Social Transformation

For the 2026 municipal elections, the **Faire mieux pour Montpellier** (Do better for Montpellier) list marks a turning point. While it relies on the programmatic base of La France Insoumise, it now claims a **broad gathering dynamic** with citizen forces (Cause Commune) and radical ecology (the REV, Julia Mignacca).

In Montpellier, this strategy translates into:

* the construction of a **pole of rupture** capable of frontally opposing the outgoing socialist majority;
* the refusal of unequal metropolization and liberal management of the city;
* the affirmation of a municipal project rooted in social struggles and popular ecology.

### Local Political Positioning

The list situates itself in **frontal opposition to the current socialist municipality**. Its constituent forces denounce management deemed to serve private interests and real estate speculation, to the detriment of public services and the living environment.

Among the structuring criticisms are:

* metropolitan governance, deemed opaque and disconnected from residents' needs;
* the bétonisation (over-construction) and gentrification of working-class neighborhoods;
* the instrumentalization of ecological issues without a real will for social transformation.

The list thus claims the construction of a **citizen municipal alternative**, relying on working-class neighborhoods, the communes of the metropolis, and social mobilizations.

### Programmatic Axes of the Gathering

The list's program, enriched by contributions from Cause Commune and the REV, is built around several key axes:

*   **Local Democracy and Citizen Power**: radical transformation of governance to give power back to residents (Cause Commune);
*   **Radical Ecology and Anti-speciesism**: defense of the living world, exit from the extractivist model, and climate justice (the REV);
*   **Social Justice and Public Services**: defense of public services, fight against precariousness, and free access to essential needs;
*   **Housing and Fight Against Speculation**: strict rent control, halting useless large real estate projects, and the right to housing for all.

### An Articulation Between Local and National Issues

**Faire mieux pour Montpellier** assumes a political reading according to which municipal policies are the first lever of resistance to neoliberal policies. Nathalie Oziol's candidacy is part of this desire to make Montpellier a pioneer city of social and ecological change.
