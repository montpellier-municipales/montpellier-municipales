**Faire mieux pour Montpellier** (Do better for Montpellier) is the coalition list of the radical left and popular ecology for the 2026 municipal elections. Initially led by **La France Insoumise (LFI)**, it has expanded to become the main alternative pole to current metropolitan policies.

The list now brings together:
*   **La France Insoumise (LFI)**: an anti-liberal, environmentalist, and republican movement.
*   **Cause Commune**: a citizen collective rooted in local neighborhoods and committed to local democracy.
*   **The REV (Ecological Revolution for the Living)**: a radical and anti-speciesist ecological organization.
*   **Figures from political ecology**, such as Julia Mignacca, and social movements.

The list is led by **Nathalie Oziol**, MP for Hérault.

### Nathalie Oziol and the Gathering of the Left

Nathalie Oziol is the MP for the **2nd constituency of Hérault**. She has been involved for a long time in local social and political mobilizations and regularly intervenes on issues related to public services, precariousness, ecology, and public freedoms.

Her candidacy embodies a desire to **unite the forces of social and ecological transformation** around a project that breaks with the outgoing municipal management. The rallying of Cause Commune, REV, and figures like Julia Mignacca marks a key step in building this assumed left-wing pole.
