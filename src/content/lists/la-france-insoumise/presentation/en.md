**La France Insoumise (LFI)** is a national political movement founded in 2016 around a program of social, ecological, and democratic transformation. It defines itself as an **anti-liberal, environmentalist, and republican** movement, structured around local action groups and a national program, *L’Avenir en commun* (A Shared Future).

In Montpellier, LFI has a long-standing presence through activists, local action groups, and national and local elected officials. For the 2026 municipal elections, the movement has announced its intention to present an **Insoumise list**, part of LFI's national strategy to intervene directly in major cities.

The list is led by **Nathalie Oziol**, MP for Hérault.

### Nathalie Oziol and LFI's Local Roots

Nathalie Oziol is the MP for the **2nd constituency of Hérault**. She has been involved for a long time in local social and political mobilizations and regularly intervenes on issues related to public services, precariousness, ecology, and public freedoms.

Her designation as head of the list fits into a logic of **continuity between parliamentary work and municipal action**, with LFI defending the idea that different institutional levels must be articulated in the service of the same political project.
