**Les Écologistes** (formerly Europe Ecology – The Greens) constitute a national political movement structured around ecological, social, and democratic issues. The movement advocates for an ecological transformation of society articulated with social justice, local democracy, and ecological planning.

In Montpellier, Les Écologistes have a long-standing presence, both activist and institutional, and have participated in various electoral configurations and municipal majorities over the past decades.

For the 2026 municipal elections, Les Écologistes have announced the formation of an **autonomous ecologist list**, titled **"Printemps montpelliérain"** and led by **Jean-Louis Roumégas**.

### Jean-Louis Roumégas and Political Ecology in Montpellier

Jean-Louis Roumégas is a historical figure of local and national political ecology. A former Member of Parliament, he has been involved for many years in environmental, democratic, and social issues.

His designation as head of the list for the 2026 municipal elections is part of the desire of some Montpellier ecologists to **reaffirm a distinct ecological political identity**, separate from coalition logics dominated by other left-wing forces.
