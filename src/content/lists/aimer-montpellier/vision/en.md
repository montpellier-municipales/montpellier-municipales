## A Reconstruction Strategy on the Right

For the 2026 municipal elections, Les Républicains in Montpellier are part of a process of **political reconstruction**, after several difficult electoral cycles at the local level.

This strategy relies notably on:

* the constitution of a **clearly identified LR list**;
* the desire to offer a right-wing alternative to the outgoing majority;
* the refusal to disperse votes among several competing candidacies from the same political space.

## Local Political Positioning

The list led by Isabelle Perrein positions itself in **municipal opposition** to the majority led by socialist mayor Michaël Delafosse.

Public positions associated with Les Républicains generally emphasize:

* **security and public tranquility**;
* financial management of the municipality and the metropolis;
* economic and commercial attractiveness of the city center;
* the quality of municipal services.

This positioning aims to offer a right-wing alternative to voters dissatisfied with the current municipal management.

## Programmatic Axes from the Program

The municipal program of the "Aimer Montpellier" list has been made public. It is articulated around several structuring axes, presented as the fruit of field work carried out neighborhood by neighborhood.

### Security and Public Tranquility

Security constitutes a central axis of the project. The list proposes a significant reinforcement of the municipal police, with an increased network of police stations in neighborhoods, a permanent presence day and night, and the development of an Urban Supervision Center equipped with reinforced technical means. The program claims a policy of **"zero tolerance"** towards delinquency, inspired by measures applied in other large cities.

### Mobility and Traffic

The list strongly criticizes the current mobility policy, in particular the Low Emission Zone (LEZ), presented as socially discriminatory. It proposes an approach aimed at **making the city accessible to all modes of travel**, including pedestrians, people with reduced mobility, motorists, and cyclists, with an overhaul of the traffic plan, the restoration of parking capacities, and a reform of free public transport.

### Cleanliness and Waste Management

The program highlights a severe diagnosis of the state of cleanliness of the city and waste management. It proposes a reorganization of urban cleaning, the development of sorting and the circular economy, as well as the construction of waste treatment tools presented as more efficient and less expensive than current systems.

### Urban Planning and Development

The list defends urban planning qualified as "common sense", based on the renovation of existing buildings, densification presented as controlled, and the creation of green spaces and living areas in neighborhoods. It claims to want to curb concreting and promote a more pleasant and accessible living environment.

### Economy and Employment

The project places significant importance on local economic development, with the stated objective of creating jobs for Montpellier residents. It emphasizes support for local businesses, the attractiveness of economic sectors deemed strategic, and strengthened cooperation with local companies.

### Education, Sport, Culture, and Solidarities

The program also develops proposals in the fields of education, sport, culture, health, and social action, with particular attention paid to accessibility, support for the elderly, people with disabilities, and the most vulnerable populations.
