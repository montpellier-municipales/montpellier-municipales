Isabelle Perrein aims to end the neglect of pedestrians and persons with reduced mobility (PRM) in urban transport policies.

- **Renovated Sidewalks**: A massive plan to repair broken sidewalks and remove obstacles.
- **Free City-Center Shuttles**: Specific transport for seniors and PRM to access the historical city heart.
- **Pedestrian Zones Priority**: Cyclists and scooter riders must walk in dense pedestrian areas.
- **Dedicated Accessibility Service**: A municipal unit with disability association members to validate road projects.
- **Accessible Routes App**: City app indicating barrier-free paths and adapted facilities.
