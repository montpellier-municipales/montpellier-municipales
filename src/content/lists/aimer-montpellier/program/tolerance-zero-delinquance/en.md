Inspired by the "Broken Window" theory, Isabelle Perrein proposes an absolute firmness policy to restore order in all neighborhoods of Montpellier.

- **Social Housing Exclusion**: Troublemakers to be excluded from municipal social housing.
- **Curfew for Minors**: Implemented for unaccompanied minors in sensitive areas.
- **Removal of Municipal Aid**: Cancellation of aid for repeat offenders.
- **Legal Action**: The city will systematically sue drug traffickers and perpetrators of violence.
- **Enhanced Checks**: Stricter controls for night grocery stores.
- **Increased Powers**: Pushing for municipal police to have identity check and drug control powers.
