Isabelle Perrein proposes to take culture out of institutions to bring it into every neighborhood and foster the expression of all Montpellier's talents.

- **Animated Kiosks in Public Spaces**: Neighborhood kiosks for plays, concerts, or temporary exhibitions.
- **Montpellier City App**: Direct access to the city's entire cultural offer in one click.
- **HandiPass Culture**: Free ticket for the companion of a disabled person and reserved PRM zones for all major events.
- **Culture in Schools and Streets**: Artists present in schools and creative workshops in public spaces.
- **Promotion of Local Talents**: An independent artistic committee to select young talents each year.
- **Valuation Campaigns**: Dedicated posters, podcasts, and reports for successful Montpellier artists.
- **OFF Festivals and Local Event Support**: Strengthened support for emblematic local festivals.
- **Mediterranean Cinema Festival**: Restoring its place to make Montpellier a major cinema capital.
- **Giant Annual Concert**: A major national or international musical event for all residents.
