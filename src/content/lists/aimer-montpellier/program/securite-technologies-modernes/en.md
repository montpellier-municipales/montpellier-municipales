- **360° Intelligent Cameras**: High-tech cameras with automatic license plate recognition.
- **Emergency Call Terminals**: Installed in public buildings, participating shops, schools, and high-traffic areas.
- **New Vehicles and K9 Units**: Up-to-date equipment for fast intervention.
- **Professional Training**: Continuous training for security operators.
