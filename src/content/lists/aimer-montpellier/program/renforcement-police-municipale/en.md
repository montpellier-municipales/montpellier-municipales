Isabelle Perrein proposes to transform the municipal police into a true local security tool with permanent presence in all neighborhoods of Montpellier.

- **Neighborhood Mapping**: Police stations in every district with dedicated teams.
- **24/7 Presence**: Central station open day and night, filling the 4:30 AM to 8:00 AM gap.
- **Operational Support Group (GSO)**: Specialized, better-equipped units for interventions.
- **Harassment Unit**: A team dedicated to fighting street harassment.
- **Police Cadets**: Encouraging youth involvement in public safety.
