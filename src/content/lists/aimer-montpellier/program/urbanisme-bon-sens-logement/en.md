Isabelle Perrein proposes to rebuild the city on itself to create green and peaceful neighborhoods while ensuring affordable prices.

- **End Urban Sprawl**: Smart densification with well-designed buildings and cool islands between them.
- **Renovate Instead of Demolish**: Stop massive demolition to protect the environment and rehabilitate heritage for modern, durable housing.
- **Rehabilitated Social Housing**: Thermal renovation, caretakers, reinforced insulation, and solar panels to reduce tenant bills.
- **Affordable Home Ownership**: Maintaining affordable prices for residents.
- **Vibrant Districts**: A "beating heart" in every neighborhood with lively squares, fountains, and outdoor coworking spaces.
- **Parc Montcalm Protection**: Classified and developed for full citizen enjoyment.
- **Local Services**: Reserving ground-floor spaces for daycare, solidarity grocery stores, and health centers.
