Isabelle Perrein proposes to end a dogmatic vision of transport by reconciling all modes of travel to fluidify the city.

- **External Circulation Ring**: Implementation of a bypass to avoid transit through the city center.
- **Tunnels and Escape Routes**: Tunnel at the Grand M roundabout and lanes at the Zenith to unblock city entrances.
- **Reopening of Closed Parking**: Reopening of Marché aux Fleurs and Comédie parking lots to support local businesses.
- **2 Hours Free Parking**: Implementation of 2 hours of free parking in public spaces and TAM parking.
- **Priority Access for Emergencies**: Reopening of closed streets and facilitated access for emergency services and caregivers.
- **Bus Reform**: Ending empty buses, replaced by more frequent and adapted local minibuses.
- **Socially Just Free Transport**: A redesigned free transport system to be socially equitable.
