**Isabelle Perrein** is leading a list titled **"Aimer Montpellier"** (Loving Montpellier) for the 2026 municipal elections. She publicly presents herself as a **free candidate, without partisan labels**, coming from civil society and claiming independence from political parties.

In her program, she states that she does not answer to "any party logic" and places her commitment under the sign of proximity to the residents and neighborhoods of Montpellier.

However, this candidacy benefits from the **political support of several right-wing and centrist groups**, notably **Les Républicains (LR)**, the **Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI)**, and the **Democratic Movement (MoDem)**, which places the list within the political space of the right and center-right at the local level.

**Isabelle Perrein** has been designated as the head of the list for Les Républicains for the 2026 municipal elections in Montpellier. Her commitment is part of a desire to **reaffirm a structured right-wing presence** in the local municipal debate.

Isabelle Perrein's candidacy aims to bring together voters who identify with a republican right-wing orientation, distinct from both the current socialist municipal majority and other opposition forces.
