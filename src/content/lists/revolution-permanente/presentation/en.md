**Révolution Permanente (RP)** is a political organization claiming **Trotskyism**, a Marxist current stemming from the analyses of Leon Trotsky. The movement defines itself as **anti-capitalist, internationalist, and revolutionary**, with a strategy centered on the self-organization of workers, youth, and the working classes.

Révolution Permanente was formed in France in **2022**, following an internal split in the **New Anti-Capitalist Party (NPA)**. Since then, the movement has acted independently in the political, trade union, student, and feminist fields, developing its own campaigns and electoral candidacies.

For the 2026 municipal elections in Montpellier, Révolution Permanente is presenting a list led by **Max Muller**. This marks the **movement's first participation in a municipal election in the city**.
