## Positioning for the Montpellier Municipal Elections

For the 2026 municipal elections in Montpellier, Révolution Permanente presents its list as a **local political intervention embedded in a broader strategy**, linking the municipal scale to national and international social struggles.

### A Candidacy Born of Local Struggles

Révolution Permanente highlights its roots in **local social mobilizations**: social movements, trade union struggles, student, feminist, and anti-racist mobilizations. The municipal candidacy is presented as the institutional extension of these commitments, not a break from them.

The movement aims to make the municipal campaign a space to:

* make existing social conflicts in the city visible (housing, precariousness, working conditions, access to public services);
* give political expression to demands raised by collectives, employees, residents, and students;
* challenge municipal policies deemed favorable to private economic interests at the expense of social needs.

### Political Independence and Refusal of Management Alliances

Révolution Permanente claims an **independent list**, without electoral alliances with parties that have held or hold municipal or governmental management responsibilities.

This orientation is based on the idea that the municipality is a **site of political conflict**, not just a space for technical management. RP thus defends the use of municipal institutions as a lever to support social struggles, rather than as a goal of power in itself.

### Programmatic Axes Generally Highlighted

Without a definitively finalized municipal program at this stage, Révolution Permanente regularly highlights several structuring axes in its public interventions:

* **Housing**: criticism of real estate speculation, defense of the right to housing, requisition of vacant housing, and opposition to evictions;
* **Labor and Public Services**: support for the struggles of municipal agents, defense of local public services, and improvement of working conditions;
* **Local Democracy**: promotion of forms of self-organization, local assemblies, and citizen control over municipal decisions;
* **Anti-racism and Equality**: fight against discrimination, support for undocumented people, and defense of equal rights;
* **Social Ecology**: an approach linking ecological issues and social justice, with a critique of environmental policies deemed incompatible with popular needs.

These axes are presented as inseparable from a social balance of power, not as simple technical measures.

### A Critical Vision of the Role of the Municipality

Révolution Permanente considers that the city hall cannot, on its own, profoundly transform social relations. The candidacy is therefore conceived as:

* a tool to **support and amplify existing mobilizations**;
* a means to bring radical demands into the local public space;
* a foothold to strengthen popular self-organization on a city scale.

The movement thus insists that social change comes first through collective action, mobilization, and the organization of the working classes, with the municipality being only one of the possible terrains for this political confrontation.
