**Philippe Saurel** is a well-known political figure in Montpellier:

* He was **Mayor of Montpellier** from **2014 to 2020** and **President of Montpellier Méditerranée Métropole** during the same period.
* A member of the Socialist Party until 2014, he then continued his political career as **diverse left / non-partisan** and asserted himself as a dissident figure vis-à-vis traditional party apparatuses.

During his mandate, he promoted a municipal policy combining local security, urban development, and the implementation of mechanisms sometimes perceived as innovative and others as political communication techniques (illustrated by certain citizen engagements). The **citizen movement #JeSuisUnDesDeux** notably marked this period in connection with issues of soft mobility (cycling and cycling infrastructure) in the city.

### Repositioning in the Municipal Campaign

In **June 2025**, Philippe Saurel announced that he would be **the local leader of the *Utiles* movement** (Ultra-marins, Territoires, Indépendants, Libertés, Écologie et Solidarité), a trans-partisan political movement stemming from the LIOT parliamentary group. However, he has **not yet formally announced an official candidacy** for mayor for the 2026 municipal elections, specifying that he would make his decision **in September 2025**.

In his statements, Saurel emphasized that he intended to form a **new and disinterested team**, locally rooted, before fully committing to the race. He focuses on a **trans-partisan** approach, open to all sensibilities except extremes, with the aim of gathering citizens around concrete projects for the city.

### Criticism of the Current Situation

In **July 2025**, Philippe Saurel sent a letter to the prefect to **alert on the financial situation of Montpellier Méditerranée Métropole**, judging the situation "calamitous" and criticizing the current management of debt and expenses, which, according to him, compromise the financial balance of the community.

This stance is part of a strategy of **targeted criticism towards the current municipal team** and highlighting his own political clarity as the municipal elections approach.
