## Political Positioning

Philippe Saurel has long defined himself as an elected official without a strict partisan label, positioning himself on a trans-partisan line. He publicly **supported Emmanuel Macron from the 2017 presidential campaign** and, on that occasion, participated in part of Macron's campaign team while remaining independent of La République en Marche.
Although he did not join the presidential party, several local supporters from the presidential majority preferred to support him rather than the candidate invested by LREM during the 2020 municipal elections in Montpellier, which testifies to a **political proximity with the center and the presidential majority** on certain axes, without constituting a formal adherence to a national party.

## Assessment of the 2014-2020 Mandate

### Election and Structured Opposition

During the **2020** municipal elections, Philippe Saurel failed to remain mayor:

* His "Diverse Left – LREM" list garnered **19.11% of the votes in the first round** and **34.65% in the second**, which allowed him to remain the **primary opposition force in the municipal council** with **11 seats**, behind Michaël Delafosse's socialist list which won the mayoralty.

### Actions of the Mandate

Several points marked his time at the head of Montpellier:

* **Reinforced Municipal Security**: recruitment of municipal police officers and development of video surveillance.
* **Mobility and Cycling**: citizen initiatives like the **#JeSuisUnDesDeux** movement illustrated the importance of debates around cycling infrastructure and mobility policy — often at the heart of local controversies.
* **Metropolitan Governance**: as president of the metropolis, he steered investment and inter-municipal coordination policies, which were both praised and criticized depending on local sensibilities.

## #JeSuisUnDesDeux – A Symbolic Movement of the Mandate

The **#JeSuisUnDesDeux** movement is a citizen initiative born in Montpellier around **cycling mobility issues**, notably from associations and collectives demanding better integration of facilities for bicycles and soft mobility in the city.

This movement has often served as a **media barometer of local tensions** between different visions of public space, sometimes approved or instrumentalized by deputy mayors or municipal officials during Saurel's mandate. It illustrates a **civic and activist dynamic around mobility**, which Saurel had to manage as mayor — which is part of the evaluation of his record and the local public debate.
