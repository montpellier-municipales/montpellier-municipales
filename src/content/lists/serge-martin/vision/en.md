## Political Positioning and Public Discourse

Public statements associated with Serge Martin's candidacy emphasize:

* proximity to residents;
* denunciation of a disconnect between municipal institutions and daily realities;
* a desire for renewal in local political practices.

Due to the lack of a detailed municipal program made public at this stage, it is difficult to identify precise political orientations across all municipal competencies.
