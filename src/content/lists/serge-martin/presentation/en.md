**Serge Martin** has announced his candidacy for the 2026 municipal elections in Montpellier outside of any structured political party. His approach falls within the framework of an **independent candidacy**, pursued personally, without claiming affiliation with a national organization or an existing political movement.

### An Approach Outside Political Parties

While Serge Martin is now running as an independent candidate, he has previously participated in a municipal election in Montpellier. In the previous municipal elections, he was indeed on the **list led by Mohed Altrad**.

This element helps to contextualize his recent political career and to place his current candidacy within a continuity of municipal engagement, albeit in a different form.

Serge Martin advocates for a **non-partisan** candidacy, based on a desire to address the residents of Montpellier directly.

This stance aligns with a tradition of independent municipal candidacies that highlight:

* a critique of the functioning of political parties;
* the desire to transcend classic partisan divisions;
* an approach presented as pragmatic and locally focused.

At this stage, Serge Martin's candidacy does not fit into a structured collective framework comparable to that of lists put forward by organized political movements.
