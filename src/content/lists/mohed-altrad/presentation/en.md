**Mohed Altrad** is a businessman and executive, known notably as the **owner and president of Montpellier Hérault Rugby (MHR)**, as well as the president of the Altrad industrial group. He is also a local media personality in the Montpellier agglomeration due to his economic and sporting role in the territory.

In 2025, as the campaign for the **March 2026 municipal elections in Montpellier** takes shape, several media outlets reported that Mohed Altrad **is inviting citizens to share their ideas with a view to a possible municipal candidacy**, before making an **official declaration of his candidacy**. This initiative is part of a participatory consultation process ahead of a formal decision to run.

At this stage, at the time of writing this page, **no complete list or official announcement of candidacy submission has been published** by Altrad or his associates, but his name is among those mentioned in the context of the preparation for the municipal elections.

### Judicial Context

Mohed Altrad was **convicted in December 2022** by the Paris Criminal Court in the context of what is generally called the *Laporte-Altrad affair*. In this case, he was found guilty of **active corruption, influence peddling, and misuse of corporate assets**; the court handed him an **18-month suspended prison sentence**, a **fine of 50,000 euros**, as well as an **additional penalty of ineligibility**.

This conviction, from a first instance, is **being appealed**; the procedure is still ongoing, with a Court of Appeal hearing scheduled (or postponed) to a later date.

Electorally, the mentioned conviction **does not systematically prevent the publication of a candidacy** if appeals are pending or if legal conditions for ineligibility evolve with judicial decisions. In France, the effects of an additional penalty of ineligibility can depend notably on its period of application, its confirmation on appeal, and the starting point of its legal duration.
