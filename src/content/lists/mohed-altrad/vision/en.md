## Political Positioning and Intentions

Mohed Altrad is often described as an actor **without a traditional partisan label**. In the local political sphere, his potential positioning at the head of a municipal list is perceived as an offer distinct from those structured around classic political parties (Socialist Party, La France Insoumise, Ecologists, etc.). He tends to embody a **candidacy centered on civil society, the local economy, and municipal governance**, although precise programmatic orientations remain to be formalized should a list be officially submitted.

## Place in the Montpellier Political Landscape

The rumor or intention of a candidacy by Mohed Altrad occurs in a local context where several competing lists are taking shape:

* a socialist majority around the incumbent mayor;
* left-wing or alternative left candidacies;
* citizen and independent lists;
* right-wing or centrist candidacies.

In the **2020 municipal elections in Montpellier**, Mohed Altrad had already led a list presented as **non-partisan** but federating several local sensibilities, notably featuring individuals from diverse movements and elected officials.

A possible candidacy in 2026 would be perceived as **the continuation of a logic of "outside classic parties" candidacy**, aiming to gather voters around a municipal project that he would define himself with local contributors.
