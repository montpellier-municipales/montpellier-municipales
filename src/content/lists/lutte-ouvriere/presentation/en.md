**Lutte Ouvrière** (LO) is standing in the 2026 municipal elections in Montpellier with a list composed exclusively of workers, employees, and the unemployed. Driven by the desire to make the voice of the working class heard, this list rejects the logic of traditional municipal management in favor of a political platform against capitalism.

The list highlights:
*   **The working class camp**: to denounce exploitation and the dictatorship of profit.
*   **Opposition to war**: against the militarization of society and military recruitment in high schools.
*   **Defense of public services**: demanding resources for the population rather than for private profits.

The list is led by **Morgane Lachiver**.

### Morgane Lachiver and the Working Class Struggle

Morgane Lachiver is a long-time committed activist within **Lutte Ouvrière**. Her candidacy aims to provide a political voice to those who have none in institutions: those who produce all the wealth but have no decision-making power.

For Morgane Lachiver, these elections are an opportunity to denounce a system that "offers youth to be boss fodder or cannon fodder." She firmly opposes increases in regional military budgets and the army's growing grip on youth. Her struggle is that of international solidarity of workers against capitalist barbarity and the march to war.
