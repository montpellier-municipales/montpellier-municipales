Lutte Ouvrière radically opposes a society whose motor is capital accumulation and private profit, at the expense of the general interest.

- **Capitalism and Insecurity**: Denouncing how the pursuit of profit weakens public services and makes city workers precarious.
- **Corporate Transparency**: Demanding full transparency on the accounts of large groups receiving public subsidies or managing municipal services.
- **Priority to Human Needs**: Reorganizing city priorities so public money serves basic needs (housing, health) rather than private interests.
- **Collective Mobilization**: Encouraging workers to organize and fight collectively to defend their class interests.
