Lutte Ouvrière opposes austerity policies that strangle municipalities and degrade public services essential to the population.

- **No to Budget Cuts**: Refusing budget reductions affecting basic services (education, health, transport).
- **Strengthening Municipal Staff**: Guaranteeing dignified working conditions and sufficient staffing for quality public service without resorting to precariousness.
- **Free and Accessible Services**: Defending free essential public services and their universal accessibility for modest families.
- **Support for Social Struggles**: Making the city hall a support point for workers' mobilizations against government and boss attacks.
