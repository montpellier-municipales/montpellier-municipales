Morgane Lachiver and Lutte Ouvrière denounce the increase in military budgets and the growing grip of the army on society, including at the local level.

- **No to "Cannon Fodder" and "Boss Fodder"**: Opposing massive military recruitment in Montpellier's high schools and incentives for youth to enlist.
- **Denouncing Weapon Budgets**: Exposing massive increases in regional military budgets for the defense industry while public services lack resources.
- **People's Sovereignty Against War**: Affirming the international solidarity of workers against the logic of imperialist clashes.
- **Education for Peace, Not War**: Schools should be places of emancipation, not ante-rooms for the army or bosses.
