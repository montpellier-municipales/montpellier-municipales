The Lutte Ouvrière list in Montpellier is composed exclusively of workers, unemployed, and retirees from the working world, refusing career politicians.

- **Candidates from the ranks**: Workers, employees, caregivers, teachers, and precarious workers who know the reality of life and work.
- **Refusing career politics**: Opposing professional politicians who serve themselves instead of the population.
- **Democratic control**: Elected members on the list are accountable to their voters and commit to defending the workers' program.
- **Internationalist commitment**: A list that rejects nationalist divisions and affirms solidarity among all workers, regardless of origin.
