Morgane Lachiver and Lutte Ouvrière are standing to represent the voice of those who run society but never have a say in how it works.

- **Spokesperson for the exploited**: Representing the demands of workers, employees, and the unemployed against bourgeois policies.
- **Exposing the profit-driven system**: Highlighting how local issues are rooted in a society dominated by money.
- **Trusting the working class**: Relying on those who work to reorganize society according to the needs of the majority.
- **A vote of conscience**: Offering voters a way to affirm their belonging to the working-class camp.
