As the March 2026 municipal elections approach, **Cité Bergère** is emerging as one of the emblematic issues of the local debate. This agricultural plot located in the heart of Montpellier crystallizes central issues: **urban planning, biodiversity, local democracy, access to land, and choice of city model**.

Beyond a simple contested real estate project, Cité Bergère has become a **political marker** allowing to distinguish the positions and commitments of the various competing lists.

## Cité Bergère: A Unique Agricultural Plot in the City Center

Located on Avenue Saint-Lazare, in the Beaux-Arts district, Cité Bergère is **the last agricultural plot still in operation in Montpellier's city center**. Historically used for family market gardening, it constitutes today:
- a **nourishing space**;
- a **cool island** in a city strongly exposed to heatwaves;
- a **reservoir of urban biodiversity**;
- a rare **landscape and social heritage**.

Since 2025, a **real estate project planning the construction of two buildings** on part of the land has sparked a major citizen mobilization.

## Structured Citizen Mobilization

Faced with this project, a collective named **"Préservons la Cité Bergère"** (Let's Preserve Cité Bergère) was formed. It defends the **full preservation of the plot** and proposes an alternative project: the creation of an **urban farm with an agricultural, ecological, and educational vocation**, possibly carried by the city or by an associative structure.

A petition launched in the summer of 2025 collected **more than 26,000 signatures**, testifying to broad local support. The collective then challenged **all lists running in the municipal elections**, asking them to publicly commit to this issue.

Find up-to-date information on the signatories of the open letter on the collective's website: [preservonslacitebergere.fr](https://www.preservonslacitebergere.fr/municipales-2026/).  
You can also support the initiative by [signing the petition on Change.org](https://www.change.org/p/contre-la-disparition-de-la-derni%C3%A8re-terre-agricole-du-centre-ville-de-montpellier?utm_medium=custom_url&utm_source=share_petition&recruited_by_id=5a4666e0-c396-012f-fe05-4040aa777426).

## The Position of Outgoing Mayor Michaël Delafosse

To date, **Michaël Delafosse**, the outgoing mayor (PS), **has not made a clear commitment in favor of the total preservation of Cité Bergère**.

During debates in the municipal council, the majority:
- **rejected a motion from the opposition** requesting the preemption of the plot by the City;
- recalled that the **Metropolitan PLUi** provides for the preservation of about **80% of the land**, while maintaining a buildable part.

The mayor mentioned holding discussions with the owners and residents, but **without enacting a decision legally guaranteeing the agricultural sustainability of the site**. For the citizen collective, this position effectively amounts to **letting the real estate project proceed**.

## Clear Commitments from Several Opposition Lists

### Nathalie Oziol (La France Insoumise)

In a **video published on social networks**, Nathalie Oziol made an explicit commitment:

> "With the #FaireMieuxPourMontpellier list, we commit to preserving the Cité Bergère plot against the real estate project that Michaël Delafosse is allowing to happen.
> This space is a wealth, an agricultural plot in the middle of the city, a common heritage."

This stance clearly places Cité Bergère among the **programmatic commitments of the LFI list**.

---

### Jean-Louis Roumégas (Printemps montpelliérain – Les Écologistes)

The ecologist list led by Jean-Louis Roumégas also supports the collective's approach. It highlights:
- the **preservation of urban agricultural lands**;
- the need for legal tools (preemption, zoning change, land protection);
- **co-construction with residents**.

Printemps montpelliérain indicated that it **would sign the commitment proposed by the collective**.

---

### Révolution Permanente

The list led by **Max Muller** has also committed to preserving Cité Bergère and supporting an alternative agricultural project, falling within a logic of **rupture with speculative urbanism**.

---

## A Still Notable Silence from Some Candidacies

At this stage, no detailed public position has been made public regarding Cité Bergère for:
- **Mohed Altrad**;
- **Isabelle Perrein** (list supported by LR, UDI, and Modem).

The collective indicated that it would make public the responses — or lack of response — from the different lists.

## An Issue That Goes Beyond Just the Neighborhood

Cité Bergère poses a central political question for Montpellier:
> **Can we improve the city without sacrificing its last agricultural and natural spaces?**

It questions:
- the place of **housing vis-à-vis land speculation**;
- the capacity of local authorities to **preempt and protect land**;
- the consistency of discourses on **net zero artificialization**;
- the reality of **local democracy** in the face of projects already tied up.

As such, Cité Bergère is much more than a local file: it has become a **symbol of the societal choices proposed to the residents of Montpellier in 2026**.
