The billionaire and owner of Montpellier Hérault Rugby (MHR), **Mohed Altrad**, officially announced his candidacy for the municipal elections of Montpellier on January 15, 2026. Already a candidate in 2020, he is trying his luck again with a discourse centered on authority, employment, and "entrepreneurial" management of the city.

A look back at this announcement, his program, and the questions it raises.

## A Second Candidacy After a First Failure in 2020

Mohed Altrad is not a newcomer to Montpellier political life. In 2020, he ran for municipal elections and obtained:

- **13.3% in the first round**,
- **18.2% in the second round**, after merging with a list from the alternative left.

He then came third, behind Philippe Saurel and the current mayor **Michaël Delafosse (PS)**.

Elected as a municipal and metropolitan councilor, he **never sat** during the mandate, before resigning in 2024.

Six years later, he returns with a new campaign and an assumed positioning:
> "Montpellier does not need another politician but a builder."

## A Billionaire Entrepreneur Profile

Mohed Altrad heads the **Altrad Group**, a world giant in scaffolding and industrial services.
Some figures:

- 20th professional fortune in France (Challenges ranking)
- About **70,000 employees worldwide**
- **5.9 billion euros in turnover in 2025**
- Owner of **Montpellier Hérault Rugby**

He claims a personal trajectory of a "self-made man", arrived in France thanks to a scholarship, often highlighted in his public speeches.

## A Highly Offensive Program on Security and Economy

During his launch meeting at Espace Dièze, in front of more than 300 people, Mohed Altrad unveiled the main lines of his program.

### Announced Social Measures
- Free school canteen
- Doubling the number of social housing units
- Possibility of accession to ownership after 15 years
- Maintenance of free transport

### Security and Public Order
- **Curfew from 10 PM for under 16s**
- **Doubling of municipal police staff**
- Creation of a municipal cleanliness brigade

### Urban Planning and Environment
- Abandonment of the incinerator / CSR project
- Massive greening plan
- Opposition to solid recovered fuels (CSR)

### Economy
- Promise of **30,000 jobs created**
- Stated objective of **"zero unemployment"**
- Freezing of local taxes
- Commitment to donate his elected official allowances to associations

## Promises That Raise Questions

### Very Ambitious Announcements...
Creating 30,000 jobs, reaching zero unemployment, or doubling the social housing stock are major objectives, which largely fall under:
- metropolitan or national competencies,
- economic dynamics largely external to municipal power.

No concrete precision has been provided for the moment on:
- the actual financing of these measures,
- their calendar,
- their compatibility with existing budgets.

### A Marked Security Vision
The curfew for minors and the massive reinforcement of the municipal police raise several questions:
- real effectiveness of these devices;
- respect for public freedoms;
- articulation with State competencies.

### A Questionable "New Man" Posture
If Mohed Altrad presents himself as outside the "political system", he:
- has already been a candidate,
- was elected,
- did not sit during his mandate,
- and regularly opposed the municipality on issues affecting his economic interests (stadium, sports facilities).

## A Candidacy Also Marked by the Judicial Context

Mohed Altrad was **sentenced in 2022 to an 18-month suspended prison sentence** for active corruption, influence peddling, and misuse of corporate assets, in a case also involving Bernard Laporte.

He also received a **two-year ineligibility sentence**, the outcome of which depends on his appeal trial scheduled for September 2026.

➡️ If this conviction were confirmed, he could not complete a possible mayoral mandate.

## A Candidacy That Shakes Up the Local Political Landscape Again

As in 2020, Mohed Altrad's candidacy could:
- fragment the electorate,
- reshuffle the cards of the first round,
- weigh on the balance between the left, ecologists, and alternative lists.

But at this stage, polls remain cautious:
a Harris Interactive poll from December 2025 credited him with about **6% of voting intentions**.

## To Follow

Mohed Altrad's candidacy raises many questions:
- What credibility for a municipal project led by a big boss?
- What compatibility between private management and public action?
- What coherence between promises and the real competencies of a city hall?

All points that deserve to be analyzed throughout the campaign.
