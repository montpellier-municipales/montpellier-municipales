## Why this website?

The municipal elections are a key moment for our city. However, it is sometimes difficult to navigate between the multiple lists, the dense programs, and campaign promises.

This is why we created this platform with three objectives:
1.  **Easily compare** proposals.
2.  **Inform** neutrally and factually.
3.  **Include** all Montpellieran residents through multilingualism.

## An Open Source Approach

This project is developed transparently. The code is open, and we invite everyone to contribute, whether to fix bugs, propose translations, or enrich the content.

Stay connected to discover program analyses as soon as they are published!
