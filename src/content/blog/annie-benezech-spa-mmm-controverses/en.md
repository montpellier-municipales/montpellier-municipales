**Annie Bénézech**, director of the Montpellier Méditerranée Métropole animal shelter (SPA MMM), appears on **Michaël Delafosse**'s list for the 2026 municipal elections. Her inclusion revives a series of public controversies that marked her tenure at the head of the shelter. No judicial conviction has been handed down against her to date — which does not preclude an examination of the reported facts.

## 2016–2017: The Standoff with Rémi Gaillard

In 2016, Montpellier video artist and animal rights activist **Rémi Gaillard** launched a crowdfunding campaign called "Rémi en cage" (Rémi in a cage): he locked himself in a cage for several hours to raise awareness of shelter animals' conditions. The operation was a spectacular success: **more than 200,000 euros** were raised, earmarked for the SPA MMM.

This is where tensions began. According to accounts reported in the local press — *Médiaterranée*, *France 3 Occitanie* — a disagreement broke out between Rémi Gaillard and the shelter's management over how the funds should be used. Gaillard wanted the money directed toward concrete animal welfare measures; management reportedly preferred to allocate it to heating and operating expenses. The "clash" was public: mutual accusations, media statements, petitions.

In this same context, the case of "Eliot" — a dog whose fate crystallized the grievances directed at management — was raised. The audio sources and veterinary testimonies mentioned at the time were never made public, which limits any objective assessment of the facts.

## Sanitary Concerns at the Shelter

The 2016–2017 tensions were accompanied by reports of sanitary conditions at the shelter, including mentions of cases of **parvovirus** — a highly contagious viral disease in dogs. These allegations resurfaced later in the context of employment tribunal proceedings.

No report from the competent veterinary authority is publicly available at this stage, making it impossible to independently assess the reality or severity of these reports.

## 2021: Animals in the Shantytowns

In 2021, during eviction operations at informal settlements across the Métropole, a specific question arose: what happened to the pets of evicted families? A report by **Sud Radio** and a statement by the **EELV** federation denounced cases of animals crushed during camp clearances, or abandoned without any solution.

The SPA MMM, whose mission includes taking in these animals, was implicitly criticized for its absence. No formal investigation results are available on this matter.

## Employment Disputes: A Contested Management Style

This is the most documented aspect. In **July 2024**, the law firm **Alteo Avocats** published two case files relating to employment tribunal proceedings involving the SPA MMM.

The first concerns a dismissal for **gross misconduct**, citing a dispute over keys. The former employee contests the stated reason, viewing it as **retaliation** for her role as a **whistleblower** — she had reportedly flagged internal dysfunctions to management.

The second file concerns an alleged case of **workplace harassment**: extended sick leave, professional email access cut off, and a lock changed at the workplace. These facts, if established, would constitute serious breaches of the employer's duty to protect employees.

An **internal audit** conducted in September 2021 is also mentioned in the documents, noting interpersonal tensions, bite injuries, and deteriorating working conditions. Here too, no final employment tribunal ruling appears in publicly available sources.

## The Political Question

This is not about declaring Annie Bénézech guilty of anything: no criminal or employment conviction has been established, and the presumption of innocence applies in full.

The question being raised is one of **political appropriateness**. When a campaign list includes a candidate whose track record is associated with recurring public conflicts, ongoing or past legal proceedings, and controversies over animal welfare and employee protection, it takes a political and symbolic risk.

In a city where animal rights mobilizes a significant portion of the electorate — with Rémi Gaillard himself standing as a candidate in 2026 — the choice of Annie Bénézech calls into question the coherence of the Delafosse list's message. The campaign's silence on this issue has so far done nothing to clarify the lead candidate's intentions.

## Points to Investigate

Several elements warrant closer examination:

- **The fate of the "Rémi en cage" funds**: were the 200,000 € subject to a public financial report? What is their traceability?
- **Veterinary and sanitary reports** on the shelter for the period 2015–2022, accessible via the Departmental Directorate for Population Protection (DDPP).
- **The status of employment tribunal proceedings**: have judgments been handed down? What amounts, what conclusions?
- **The Métropole's role** as supervisory authority over the SPA MMM: were reports received and acted upon?
- **Annie Bénézech's position**: has she publicly responded to the accusations made against her?
