[Michaël Delafosse](/en/listes/michael-delafosse), the outgoing Socialist mayor of **Montpellier**, has officially announced his candidacy for a **second term** at the head of the city for the municipal elections scheduled for **March 2026**. This announcement, expected for several weeks, formalizes a campaign already effectively initiated by the mayor since last autumn.

## An Expected but Confirmed Announcement

On January 17, 2026, Michaël Delafosse confirmed his decision to run for a new term in an **open letter to Montpellier residents** published in the regional daily *Midi Libre*, following a period of rumors and public support from various left-wing parties and allied groups.

The mayor, elected in 2020 in a four-party configuration, states that he wishes to continue the work begun six years ago, which he describes as a phase of **"very great transformation"** for Montpellier.

## First Project Elements Already Sketched

Delafosse enters the campaign with several political elements already highlighted for several months, outlining the main lines of his project for a second term:

### Free Transport and Mobility
Maintaining and **extending free public transport** for metropolitan residents constitutes one of the pillars of his action, with particular attention paid to the tram network, including the recent inauguration of **Line 5**.

### Continuity of Urban Transformation
Delafosse highlights the **consolidation of ecological and social transformations** already initiated, which he wishes to pursue.

### Renovation and Daily Life Improvement Projects
Without presenting an exhaustive campaign program so far, several ongoing local policies hint at **project axes**:
- Urban renovation, notably in neighborhoods like La Mosson;
- Strengthening social housing and developing public spaces;
- Projects related to education, local employment, or daily security.

Although these topics are not presented as a complete campaign program at this stage, they reflect the priorities displayed by Delafosse during his first term.

## A Candidacy Supported by an Enlarged Majority

The outgoing mayor can count on **broad support on the left**, including:
- Socialist Party (PS),
- Radical Party of the Left (PRG),
- Communist Party (PCF),
- Place Publique,
- Génération Écologie,
- Animalist Party.

Despite this, the left appears **divided** overall with the announced presence of competing lists, notably those led by **[Nathalie Oziol (LFI)](/en/listes/la-france-insoumise)** and **[Jean-Louis Roumégas (Greens)](/en/listes/les-ecologistes)**, complicating the local political landscape.

## Delafosse Facing an Already Started Campaign

The official announcement comes as the campaign is already well underway:
- The municipal majority has multiplied thematic assessments,
- Speeches on social networks and in neighborhoods have initiated a discourse of continuity,
- And several polls put Delafosse in the lead, comforted by the absence of a single union list of the entire left.

## What Remains to Be Unveiled

At this stage, **Delafosse has not yet published a complete program**, detailed or costed for 2026. His public statements and recent positions nevertheless outline some priorities, centered on:
- **Free and sustainable mobility**,
- **Consolidated ecological transition**,
- Urban planning and neighborhood renovation,
- As well as **social cohesion** measures.

It is less a **project of rupture** than a project of **continuation and consolidation** of policies already implemented since 2020 — a posture that can be an asset in a city where the municipal majority presents itself as experienced but also a **challenge facing a fragmented opposition**.

## Political Context

Delafosse will face several declared competitors in an already fragmented political landscape: [Mohed Altrad](/en/listes/mohed-altrad), already a candidate in 2020, officialized his candidacy a few days earlier, and other lists — ranging from the right to the far right — are also announcing themselves for March.
