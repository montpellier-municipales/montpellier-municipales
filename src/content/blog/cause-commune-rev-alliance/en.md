## A Political Alliance Announced

A little over a year before the 2026 municipal elections, the **Cause Commune** list and the **La REV – Révolution Écologique pour le Vivant** party have formalized their alliance in Montpellier. The information, revealed by the local press, marks an important step in structuring a political pole that clearly claims to break away from institutional ecological policies and the current municipal majority.

In their communication, both organizations emphasize a common desire to promote a **"breakaway ecology"**, which is simultaneously social, anti-capitalist, and rooted in concrete struggles. This orientation contrasts sharply with an ecology often deemed too compatible with the market, growth, and institutional compromises.

## Cause Commune: A Municipal Project Under Construction

Cause Commune has progressively established itself in the Montpellier political landscape as a citizen movement critical of the city's current management. Its approach is based on several structuring axes: local democracy, social justice, popular ecology, and opposition to policies deemed authoritarian or liberal led by the socialist municipality.

The alliance with La REV fits into this logic. It aims to strengthen a municipal project that is not limited to urban planning or energy transition, but which more broadly questions power relations, social inequalities, and economic choices at the local level.

## La REV: A Radical and Coherent Political Ecology

Founded around the figure of Aymeric Caron, **La REV – Révolution Écologique pour le Vivant** is distinguished by a clearly asserted political line. The party advocates an ecology that does not separate the environmental question from relations of domination, whether economic, social, or cultural.

### Antispeciesism and Defense of Living Beings

La REV places **antispeciesism** at the heart of its political project. This implies a structural questioning of animal exploitation, farming, fishing, and more broadly the productivist model that considers living beings as a resource. This approach, still marginal in the municipal debate, opens up concrete questions: food policies, collective catering, the place of animals in the city, support for peasant and plant-based agriculture.

### An Asserted Anti-Capitalist Critique

Unlike an accommodating ecology, La REV develops an explicit critique of capitalism, identified as one of the central drivers of the destruction of living beings. The party advocates a profound transformation of production, consumption, and governance models, including at the municipal and metropolitan levels.

In the context of municipal elections, this orientation translates into a rejection of unnecessary large projects, a critique of real estate speculation, and the desire to place social and ecological needs before economic attractiveness and competition between territories.

### Human Rights and International Solidarity

La REV also claims a clear commitment to **human rights**. The party has notably distinguished itself by its stances against colonial and imperialist violence, and by its explicit support for the Palestinian people in the face of mass crimes perpetrated in Gaza.

This commitment extends beyond the national framework: it is part of a political vision where local authorities have a role to play in international solidarity, twinning, cooperation, and symbolic positions. An orientation that echoes local debates on the international relations of the Montpellier city council.

## A Breakaway Ecology at the Municipal Level

The alliance between Cause Commune and La REV aims to translate these ideological orientations into a concrete municipal program. This involves thinking of ecology not as a simple technical transition, but as a project of social transformation.

In Montpellier, this could translate into:

*   a food policy favoring plant-based options and universal access to quality food;
*   a questioning of the logic of concreting and speculative densification;
*   a social approach to ecological transition, attentive to territorial inequalities;
*   strengthened local democracy, allowing residents to genuinely influence decisions.

## An Alliance That Reshapes the Local Political Landscape

This alliance comes in a context of fragmentation and recomposition on the left and in the ecological field in Montpellier. It marks the desire to build a distinct alternative to both the current socialist majority and institutional ecologists deemed too accommodating.

It remains to be seen whether this "breakaway ecology" will be able to broaden its electoral base beyond activist circles and firmly establish itself in working-class neighborhoods and the peripheries of the metropolis. But one thing is certain: the alliance between Cause Commune and La REV introduces a clear political cleavage into the upcoming municipal campaign, directly posing the question of the real content of municipal ecology.

## What This Alliance Reveals

Beyond the announcement, the union between Cause Commune and La REV raises a central question for the 2026 municipal elections: can ecology content itself with marginal adjustments, or must it assert itself as a project of rupture with dominant economic and political logics?

In Montpellier, this alliance clearly intends to answer with the latter option.
