With just over a month to go before the municipal elections, the Montpellier campaign is experiencing a new major political sequence. After several noted departures within the *Printemps montpelliérain*, **the Cause Commune collective announces its rally to the list led by Nathalie Oziol (La France insoumise)**.
A rally that also includes **REV – Ecological Revolution for the Living**, an environmental organization that joined Cause Commune last December.

This decision confirms the extent of the realignment underway on the left and accentuates the isolation of the ecological candidacy led by Jean-Louis Roumégas.

## Cause Commune and REV join the LFI list

Contrary to some hasty readings, this is not an individual rally. **It is indeed the entire Cause Commune collective, accompanied by REV, that joins the “Faire mieux pour Montpellier” (Do better for Montpellier) list** led by LFI MP Nathalie Oziol.

Cause Commune was built as a locally anchored citizen collective, around a political project combining social justice, popular ecology, and local democracy. REV, committed to ecological and climate issues, had joined the collective at the end of 2025, strengthening its militant and programmatic dimension.

Their joint rally marks an important step: it consecrates the will of these forces to fully weigh in the municipal balance of power rather than remaining in a position of observation or simple testimony.

## An assumed political decision

This choice comes in a context of accelerated clarification on the left. It follows the departures of several figures from *Printemps montpelliérain*, including Julia Mignacca, former head of the Ecologists, as well as former members of Génération·s.

For Cause Commune and REV, the decision is based on a shared observation:

*   the lack of a clear perspective of social transformation in the alliances currently defended by part of the local political ecology;
*   the refusal of a positioning judged too accommodating towards the outgoing municipal majority;
*   the will to build an assumed alternative to the social and territorial effects of metropolization.

The rally to Nathalie Oziol's list is thus presented as a **strategic choice**, based on political consistency rather than short-term electoral calculation.

## A realignment that reshapes the Montpellier left

With the joint arrival of Cause Commune and REV, the LFI list becomes the main gathering pole for forces critical of the current municipal model. It now aggregates activists from political ecology, social movements, citizen collectives, and the alternative left.

Conversely, the dynamic of *Printemps montpelliérain* appears weakened. The successive departures question the ability of the list led by Jean-Louis Roumégas to embody a credible and unified alternative.

This realignment highlights a fundamental fracture:

*   on one side, an institutional approach to ecology, inscribed in the continuity of existing balances;
*   on the other, a more radical political ecology, articulated with social issues, housing, local democracy, and the fight against territorial inequalities.

## A political stake that goes beyond the campaign

Beyond alliance games, this rally poses a central question for Montpellier: **what political response to the effects of metropolization?**

Explosion of housing prices, relegation of certain neighborhoods, feeling of abandonment in peripheral communes, distance from decision-making places: these dynamics fuel both abstention and the rise of the far right.

For Cause Commune, REV, and their allies, the municipal campaign must be an opportunity to put these issues back at the heart of public debate, and to propose an alternative based on social justice, popular ecology, and local democracy.

In this context, their rally to Nathalie Oziol's list appears less as a simple electoral episode than as **a structuring political act**, revealing the realignments underway on the left in Montpellier.
