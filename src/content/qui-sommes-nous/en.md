# Who are we?

## A citizen website to understand local political life

This site is supported by **a collective of citizens**, with **plural**, **non-partisan** political opinions, who share a common conviction:
**local democracy cannot function without clear, accessible and understandable information for everyone**.

We live, work or study in Montpellier and its metropolis. The decisions taken by the city hall and the metropolis have a direct impact on our daily lives. However, it is often difficult to understand precisely:

* who decides;
* on what basis;
* with what means;
* and with what concrete consequences.

This site was born from this difficulty.

## Why does this site exist?

### To make public action readable

Municipal politics is not limited to election campaigns. It translates into:

* budgets;
* urban projects;
* public policies;
* sometimes complex trade-offs.

We wish to **make these elements understandable**, without unnecessary jargon, so that everyone can form an enlightened opinion.

### To allow everyone to form their own opinion

Our goal is not to say who to vote for, nor to defend a list or a party.
We seek to **give keys to understanding**, to ask questions, to contextualize choices, and to compare speeches and actions.

Information only has democratic value if it allows debate.

## An independent and non-partisan approach

We are linked to **no political party**, to **no institution**, to **no economic actor**.

The members of the collective have different sensibilities. This diversity is a richness: it forces us to be rigorous, to check facts and to confront points of view.

This site defends a method more than a line:

* rely on public sources;
* cross-reference information;
* distinguish facts, analyses and opinions.

## Information, transparency and general interest

We consider that **public information belongs to everyone**.

That is why we work in particular from:

* administrative documents;
* budget data;
* public deliberations;
* and identified journalistic sources.

Our approach is part of a requirement for **democratic transparency**: understanding how public money is used, how priorities are set, and how decisions are made.

## The local and national media context

We note, like many, that information is today produced in a context of **strong media concentration**, including at the local level.

This concentration can reduce:

* the diversity of points of view;
* the place given to substantive issues;
* the capacity to question the powers in place.

Without opposing existing media, this site aims to be **complementary**: a space for analysis, putting things into perspective and civic pedagogy.

---

## Who is this site for?

This site is addressed to:

* the inhabitants of Montpellier and its metropolis;
* people who will vote in the municipal elections;
* those who wish to understand local issues without being specialists;
* curious, committed or simply concerned citizens.

No prior knowledge is necessary.

## How do we use this site?

You will find:

* explanatory articles on the competences of the city hall and the metropolis;
* analyses of budgets and public policies;
* contextualization of municipal news;
* insights into local social, ecological and democratic issues.

Each content aims to answer simple questions:

* **What are we talking about?**
* **Who decides?**
* **What are the concrete effects?**
* **What alternatives exist?**

---

## An open and evolving approach

This site is neither fixed nor definitive.
It will evolve with:

* current events;
* feedback from readers;
* access to new data.

We choose **clarity**, **pedagogy** and **good faith**.
We also know that understanding public action is a collective learning process.
